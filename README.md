## Emil Carr-Ross' Wordpress Things v1.03

This plugin contains a mishmash of things I use in my wordpress themes.

**Blocks**

* Background Container - A simple wrapper block that allows you to set its background image/colour.
* Callout - A sleek block with an image, bold text and button inviting the user to take action.
* Jumbo - Super jumbo header text
* Reveal - A dropdown box (adapted from rebellion.earth)
* Slideshow - a fade-in-out slideshow built on responsiveSlides.js
* Socials - a block which shows social media icons in a row.
* Events List - display a list of ecr-event posts.

**Custom Post Types**

* Event - Speaks for itself. Uses event-details block to store start date&time, end date&time, location, postcode of an event.

**Dependencies**

This plugin relies on the Timber Library: https://wordpress.org/plugins/timber-library/

This plugin also makes some assumptions on where files in your theme are stored. Good luck lol. (WIP)
